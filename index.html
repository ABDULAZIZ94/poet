				<h2>What is Poet?</h2>
				<p>Poet is a blog generator in node.js to generate routing, render markdown posts, and get a blog up and running <em>fast</em>. Poet may not make you blog-famous, and it may give you one less excuse for not having a blog, but, just imagine the insane hipster cred you get for having a blog in node.js. <em>"Cool blog, is this Wordpress or something?"</em> your square friend asks. <em>"Nah dude, this is in node,"</em> you respond, while skateboarding off into the sunset, doing mad flips and stuff. Little do they know you just used Poet's autoroute generation to get your content up in that internet.</p>
